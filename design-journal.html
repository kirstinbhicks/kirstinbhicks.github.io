        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: I would love to learn the basics of website creating. I know it's a lot of learning but would hopefully lead me to designing a very professional online portfolio one day.</p>
        <p>Inspiring site of the week: I really enjoyed the interface of this clothing site. It works on a really nice grid. If you look at the clothing items, when hovering over a product an "add to cart" buttom appears. Once hovering over this button, a list of sizes appears to select. <a href="https://www.frankandoak.com"></a>Frank and Oak</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response:For project one, I would like to create a site based on Norse mythology. For content, I am aiming to include a list of popular gods, the realms in which they live, the dwarves from lore, and celebrated holidays. To create cohesion, I plan on using the same header for each page with buttons to navigate through pages (the header will have a different title based on the page). I also would like to use the same typefaces, illustrative, and color palette across pages. The information provided on each page will vary greatly including unique layouts of descending information as the user scrolls down each page. I would like to tie in the color palette into Scandinavian color theory. I would also like to use a hand crafted typeface for my headers, to relate to nordic runes and symbols; I will create images with this font on top for each header.</p>
